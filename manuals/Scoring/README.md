# Autobiographical Interview Scoring Manual

## What to Score:
* Score when there is an addition of data or anything new to the sentence. Example: “She wore a dress” vs “She wore a dress at the party in….”. 
* If a participant mentions multiple memories that fit the time frame then score the memory that is closer to the prompt asked. If the memories mentioned are all relevent to the prompt then score the first memory as internal and the other memory or memories as external
* If a participant was interrupted **by the experimenter (after 4 minutes of recall)** before he/she could finish we can score and include the sentences they say until the experimenter stops them and moves on to the questions. Note: for interruptions that not the experimenter telling the participant to move on (Zoom issues, distractions), this will mean we exclude the trial instead  
* A year or two outside the time period is fine unless if it’s before the age of 5. 
    - Childhood: Down to 5 and up to 11 years old
    - Adolescence: Down to 12 and up to 19 years old 
    - Adulthood: Down to 19 and up to 27 years old 
* Usually a clause will be scored (contains a subject and predicate) <strong>BUT</strong> a clause may contain more than one detail
      - “He had a brown, old hat” would be scored as 2 perceptual details because the word “old” significantly alters the clause but "I went to the park" would be scored as one place detail

* What is one episode: one episode can span 48 hours



## What happens when a transcription error is discovered?
1) Contact the transcriber on slack, in the message sent make sure to include the row number so the transcriber can double check the transcription 
2) If the transcriber makes changes then these changes will be made in the original transcript. These changes will also be highlighted in the original transcript (rows with the changes will be highlighted)
3) The scorer must insure that the changes in the original transcript are copied to there scoring copy 
  

## Internal vs External:
* Internal details: directly relate back to the 'episode' of the prompt in the correct time period. If details reflect occurrences, locations, perceptions, thoughts, or emotions specific to prompt (within a 48-hour window) given
  -	If you think you can <strong> reasonably </strong> score it as internal, then score as internal 
* External details: Details not specific to the time and place of the prompt given
* Event, Place, Time, Perceptual and Emotion/Thought details can be internal or external
* Semantic, Repetitions and Other details are always external
* If a participant says “ I have a friend named ….” Or something similar to this and if that person is involved in the memory then its internal, if not then its external
* If a participant mentions they are remembering something because they have a photo or movie, details specifically remembered from the photo or movie are scored as *external* because they are not actually details the participant necessarily remembered specifically from the time of the event (i.e. these details are likely recalled from later viewing of the photo/movie). 


## 	Categories of Details:
## Refer back to the Autobiographical Scoring Instructions (found in the manuals folder on github ) for more information about each category, what is added below is just *clarifying* points 

* Event details:
  -	Describing clothing or anything else is considered event details IF it plays a part in the memory and it’s not part of the landscape or environment
  - Don’t score “ I went to the park “ like a event and a place, score as a place detail 
  - Dialogue: considered 1 event detail regardless of length of quote except if the quotes are separated
  - If you can put a detail in a more specific category then you should do that!
  - Information about sequence of events is event details
  - Inferences about the thoughts or feelings of others are event details (example, "Sally was annoyed")


* Place details:
  -	If a participant mentioned city and state then that’s two place details

* Time details: 


  -	If a participant says something along the lines of  “ it was during elementary school”  than it is scored as semantic if the prompt also mentioned elementary school
  - Unlike other categories do not penalize a participant if they make inferences about time details


* Perceptual details 


  -	Duration is scored as perceptual 
  - One's own orientation is scored as perceptual
  - Objects that are part of the landscape (“there were red curtains”, “There were lit candles everywhere”) are perceptual
* Emotion/Thought details
  -	Phrases like” She was a good writer” are scored as emoDETint IF it is a thought/belief that is connected to the actual even being talked about
  -	If a participant says something along the lines of “I thought” score as emotion/thought detail
  - A thought or emotion about an external event is scored as a emotion/thought detail external 
  - Feelings that  relate to speaker are emotion/though details (ex. "Sally was annoyed with me")


* Semantic details
  
  - If a semantic detail builds on the memory, adds on too it or connects to it than the detail is considered event detail
  -	Grading of a memory about frequency, “the only time …. “or “Every Monday…” is scored as semantic
  -	Information that's more factual such as “the play was about …”, is scored as semantic unless it is connected to the event
  - If something “had been” its considered a  semantic detail because there is no ending or starting date, refer back to the autobiographical instructions manual
  - Long-standing thought and opinions
  - <strong>If a semantic detail becomes important to the memory prompted then it would be considered an event detail
EX: “Arizona is hot” VS “Arizona was hot when I was there” </strong>

* Repetitions
  - Repetitions are about the meaning not the exact words being used
* Other details 
  - Comments made to the experimenter are scored as other
  - “I remember five things…”  other detail and score the information if she or he elaborates

## Other things to keep in mind or questions that were sent:
* Mentioning names/titles vs saying 20 people? Answer: if the names/titles were mentioned then score each people individually and if the amount of people was stated then score as one event detail 
* When there are many adjectives, emotions, sounds, etc. in one sentence, do we count each one as a separate detail? Answer: Follow an additive way of scoring
* If they say “by days end” it “at the beginning of the day” or “sometime that day” is that a time detail? Answer: Depends on how specific and which one is used. “Sometime that day” is too general but “beginning of the day” is specific enough
* How would you score hypotheticals? EX: "I would have gone down had it not been for max Cleveland, one of Georgia’s US senators and a triple Vietnam amputee, who was next to me in his wheelchair". Answer: A hypothetical if it’s about the internal memory is scored as emotion/thought detail
