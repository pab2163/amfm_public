Can you hear & see me?

[TROUBLESHOOT ANY ZOOM ISSUES WITH PARTICIPANT]


Thank you so much for participating in this study! We really appreciate the time and effort taken
to participate, especially with the challenges of the pandemic and setting up these video calls.
During this session, I’ll ask you some questions to help determine your eligibility to take part in
the study first. If so, then we’ll spend a little time talking about some music artists you may or
may not have listened to before, and going over a list of memories that may or may not have
occurred in your life. Before we begin, I want to ask if you had any questions about anything on the consent form.
Is there anything I can clarify for you? 

[answer any questions]

Awesome! Over the course of the session today, we'll do a couple different activies.
The session will most likely take around 30-45 minutes. 
But, if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know!
Any questions before we begin?
