Now, I'm going to read you a list of events that may have happened in your life. 
For each event, please tell me 'yes' if you can remember a specific instance of that event and 'no', if you do not. 
When you tell me whether you can remember each event, please only say 'yes' if you can recall a *specific* instance of this event 
For example, if the prompt is 'playing a childhood game', only say yes if you remember a specific time playing a game. 
If you can remember that you did play games in childhood, but do not recall a specific time, please say 'no'
I may ask you to recall events in detail later on, so if you would not feel comfortable discussing a particular event, please say 'no' 
We do not expect every event I read to you to have happened in your life, so please do not worry if you have not experienced or do not recall some of these events.

Do you have any questions?
